# Image-Binarization-Project
The first free and open-source Telugu palm leaf dataset to advance research in digitization and Optical Character Recognition (OCR) of ancient Telugu scripts.The dataset consists of 36 images of Telugu palm leaf manuscripts.And divide these 36 images into patches of size 256*256 and apply augmentation and data loaders to make 20,000 images.We evaluated several binarization algorithms, including Otsu, Niblack, and Sauvola, by creating ground truth images to assess their performance on the dataset. Additionally, we explored the effectiveness of deep learning models such as U-Net, LinkNet, and PSPNet,UNetPlusPlus,FPN in improving binarization quality. Our efforts contribute to the preservation of cultural heritage and foster the development of advanced image processing and machine learning techniques for analyzing historical documents.
